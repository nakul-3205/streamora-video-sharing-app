# Streamora

Streamora is a blazing-fast short video sharing platform, inspired by YouTube Shorts. Built using Next.js, MongoDB, and ImageKit, it allows users to upload videos and explore content shared by others — all in a clean, minimal interface.

## Features

- Upload short videos
- View others' videos with lightning speed
- Smart compression via ImageKit
